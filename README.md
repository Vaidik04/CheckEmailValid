# 📧 Email Validator in Python

A simple Python program that validates user input as a proper **email address** using multiple rule checks.  
It helps users understand the basic structure of valid emails while learning about string handling and conditional logic in Python.

## 🧠 How It Works

This program checks whether an entered email address is **valid or invalid** based on several conditions:

1. ✅ The email must be at least 6 characters long.  
2. ✅ The first character must be an alphabet letter.  
3. ✅ It must contain exactly one “@” symbol.  
4. ✅ A dot “.” must appear **either 3 or 4 characters before the end** (like `.com` or `.in`).  
5. 🚫 The email cannot contain spaces or uppercase letters.  
6. ✅ Only letters, numbers, underscores `_`, dots `.`, and the `@` symbol are allowed.
